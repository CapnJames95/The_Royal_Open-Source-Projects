***NOTES:*** 
- There are two Case files of different design.  One is meant for direct self-threading M2 screws (2mm ID Holes) and the other is meant for use with heat-set inserts (2.5mm ID Holes)
- This case is designed to fit the "standard" or common print bed size of 250mm wide.  Its **VERY** close so if you have un-even heating on your bed or slight offset alignment, you may run into issues with a print this close to the edge.

### Exact Case Dimensions:

- **249.89mm x 88.2mm**
